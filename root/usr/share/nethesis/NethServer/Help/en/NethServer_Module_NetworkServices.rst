Network services
================

The table shows all network services running locally on the server.

Each service can have multiple TCP/UDP ports open.
Ports are open into the firewall accordingly to the `access` property.

Edit

Zones
    Select the zones from which clients are allowed to connect to the service.
    If none is selected, access is granted to the local host only.
